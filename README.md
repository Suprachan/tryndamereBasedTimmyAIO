# TimmyAIO

This is a project Created for Rift, a scripting platform for League of Legends. It's for eductional purposes.

I've decided to lisence this project under the BSD-2 Clause. If you use my code in your plugin, I require you to credit the owner(me) appropriately in both your plugin page and the source code. 

Note that claiming this code as your own is an overall dick move and not appreciated in the community at all.

# Requirements
- DirectX SDK (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812)
- RMAN's sdk wrapper (https://gitlab.com/rman200/rift-sdk-extensions/tree/master) (clone this into the directory containing timmyAIO)
